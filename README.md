# online-election-portal
OLEC  allows a person to cast his/her vote online and also allows him/her to register as a candidate, while all of this is being controlled by an administrator. 
The online election portal was designed to cater to the needs of any college/school/enterpriseâ€™s election procedure to reduce usage/wastage of paper and to emphasize on the ease of operation so as to save time, once taken to the technical platform.
